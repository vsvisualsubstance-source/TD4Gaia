Timer CHOP Callbacks

me - this DAT

timerOp - the connected Timer CHOP
cycle - the cycle index
interrupt - True if the user initiated a premature, False if a result of a 
	normal timeout
fraction - the time in 0-1 fractional form

segment - an object describing the segment:
	can be automatically cast to its index: e.g.:  segment+3, segment==2, etc
	
	members of segment object:
		index	 numeric order of the segment, from 0
		owner	Timer CHOP it belongs to
		
		lengthSeconds, lengthSamples, lengthFrames
		delaySeconds, delaySamples, delayFrames
		beginSeconds, beginSamples, beginFrames
		speed
